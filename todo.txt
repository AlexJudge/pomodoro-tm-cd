 + start/stop from toolbar (dima)
 + pomodoro icon in toolbar (dima)
 + tooltip in toolbar with pomodoro amount (dima)
 + should be able to change pomodoro shortcut
 + better pomodoro icon.. or copy one from pomodoro app
 + persist pomodoro amount
 + persist pomodoro time (in case IDEA is restarted during pomodoro) (dima)
 - configuration panel
 - sound volume configuration (mq0)
 - minimize, block window on pomodoro end
 + "Better" popup.. search for "Compilation completed with xxx warnings", "Loaded classes are up-to-date nothing to
reload"?
 - task name and stats


UI tweaks:
 - pomodoro label shouldn't shift on pomodoro start/stop (only happens in IntelliJ... and not all the time)

bugs:
 + 3 seconds delay after clicking "Start" before timer update
 - Pomodoro toolkit window is disabled when project is being indexed (for example, maven and IDE talk windows are not disabled)

Would be nice to have:
 - jira integration
 - integration with IDEA talk plugin (show pomodoro status there) ?
