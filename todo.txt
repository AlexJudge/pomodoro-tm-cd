 - task name and stats
 + block window on pomodoro end

UI tweaks:
 - pomodoro label shouldn't shift on pomodoro start/stop (only happens in IntelliJ... and not all the time)

bugs:
 - Pomodoro toolkit window is disabled when project is being indexed (for example, maven and IDE talk windows are not disabled)
 - after restart pomodoro rings without a good reason
 + 3 seconds delay after clicking "Start" before timer update

Would be nice to have:
 - statistics, task name (with auto-completion)
 - integration with tasks
 - jira integration?
 - integration with IDEA talk plugin (show pomodoro status there) ?
